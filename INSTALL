Argus PEP client API
--------------------

1. First you have to bootstrap the autotools:

./autotools.sh

2. Then use configure (default prefix: /opt/emi):

./configure

or if you want to install the lib and include in a different directory:

./configure --prefix=/usr [--libdir=/usr/lib64]

3. Build the library:

make

and install it:

make install

4. you are all done :)

The library libargus_pep_api and the header files are now installed. 
To use it, simply include the library header in your code:

#include <pep/pep.h>

A pkg-config configuration file libargus-pep-api.pc is available in $libdir/pkgconfig.
You can use it in your autoconf configure.ac as descibed here:
